  assistant_message1 = "Research suggests that social media can have significant negative impacts on the mental health of teenagers. Studies indicate a causal relationship between excessive social media use and reduced well-being, particularly during crucial developmental stages like puberty and young adulthood, with depression and anxiety being common outcomes. Furthermore, platforms often serve as breeding grounds for online discrimination, prejudice, hate speech, and cyberbullying, which can inflict serious psychological harm. Exposure to content related to self-harm, harm to others, or eating disorders poses significant risks to young individuals. Researchers are actively investigating the mechanisms underlying these impacts and why they disproportionately affect certain demographic groups, such as girls or young adults, underscoring the importance of understanding these dynamics for effective policy interventions. Despite these negative aspects, social media also offers opportunities for teens to stay connected with friends, form identities, and find support. Striking a balance between acknowledging the positives and mitigating the negatives is crucial for providing targeted guidance to teenagers, caregivers, and policymakers alike."

The Rajasthan Royals have shown strong form, with players like Sanju Samson performing well and the team having a good balance in both batting and bowling departments. On the other hand, the Delhi Capitals have faced challenges, especially with their middle order and pace attack. The match is expected to take place at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur, where the Royals will aim to continue their winning streak and establish their dominance. Therefore, the prediction leans towards the Rajasthan Royals winning the match."
